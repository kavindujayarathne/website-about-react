              <p>
                In the latest iteration of this website's design, I have taken a
                significant leap forward with the integration of CSS custom
                properties, a step beyond conventional styling techniques. This
                advancement is not merely a shift towards modern practices but
                an embrace of a more dynamic and flexible approach to theming
                our components.
              </p>
              <h2>Efficient Use of Custom Properties:</h2>
              <p>
                I've employed custom properties to centralize control over the
                styling values, allowing for a single point of reference for
                colors and shadows that are used throughout our card components.
                This method streamlines the codebase, eliminating the repetitive
                and tedious task of declaring styles for each card variant. With
                this system, updates to the theme or style can be made
                universally and instantaneously, with changes propagating
                throughout the site, ensuring consistency and coherence.
              </p>
              <h2>Introduction of Private Properties:</h2>
              <p>
                Delving deeper, I have explored the concept of 'pseudo-private'
                custom properties by prefixing them with an underscore (--_).
                This innovative practice implies a private scope, signaling
                these properties are specific to a component's internal styling.
                This naming convention draws inspiration from programming
                languages where private variables are commonplace, thereby
                importing a similar paradigm into CSS. Such a strategy aids in
                preventing unintended overrides and encapsulating styles within
                their respective domains.
              </p>
              <h2>Code Implementation and Advantages:</h2>
              <p>
                To illustrate, I've declared locally scoped custom properties
                within each card class. For example, .card1 includes --shadow
                and --border properties, which are then utilized within a
                universal .card and .card::before selector. The var(--_shadow)
                and var(--_border) functions access these properties for each
                card's box shadow and border, respectively. This approach has
                the unique advantage that should these properties exist
                globally, they would defer to the global value; however, in
                their absence, our local definition takes precedence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The transformation is evident when comparing the new code with
                the previous iteration. Before, individual .card1, .card2, etc.,
                and their corresponding ::before pseudo-elements needed separate
                declarations for each property. Now, a single universal selector
                controls both the border and the shadow by leveraging these
                custom properties, significantly reducing the redundancy in CSS.
              </p>
              <h3>The benefit of this strategy is multifaceted:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I've reduced the code footprint, leading to cleaner and more
                  maintainable stylesheets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There's a centralized control mechanism for styling, which
                  simplifies theme management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It allows for scalability, where new cards can be added with
                  minimal additional styling effort.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                I've significantly extended the fundamental HTML and CSS to
                create an engaging user experience that goes well beyond the
                basics. I have achieved this through a series of interactive and
                visual enhancements on the quiz page.
              </p>
              <h2>Input Fields Transitions</h2>
              <p>
                Starting with the input fields, I've introduced a label
                animation to indicate focus. This is implemented with CSS rules
                that set the label to position: absolute; with pointer-events:
                none;, ensuring that the label does not block clicks intended
                for the input field. The transition effect, applied to the
                label, animates smoothly over 0.4 seconds, creating a responsive
                visual cue when the user interacts with the text boxes.
              </p>
              <h2>Submit Button Animation</h2>
              <p>
                For the submit button, I have implemented a complex,
                non-interactive animation that begins as soon as the page loads.
                Four span tags create an animated border around the button, each
                moving independently thanks to the nth-child pseudo-class and
                keyframes animations with different delay intervals. The
                overflow: hidden; property on the button ensures the animated
                lines remain contained within the button's boundary. The
                keyframes animation is designed to loop infinitely, creating a
                lively effect that draws the eye.
