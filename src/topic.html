        <h1>What is React?</h1>
        <p>
          React.js, commonly just called React, is a popular JavaScript library
          used for building user interfaces, particularly for web applications.
          Developed by Facebook (now Meta Platforms), it was first released in
          2013 and has since become one of the most widely used tools in web
          development.

      <section class="section">
        <h1>What is the Purpose of React?</h1>
        <p>
          The purpose of React.js is to provide an efficient and flexible way to
          build interactive user interfaces in web applications. By organizing
          the interface into reusable components, React helps developers manage
          complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces that can
          be developed, maintained, and tested independently.

        <h1>Functions and Features</h1>
        <p>
          React.js is structured around several core functions and features that
          make it powerful for developing interactive web applications. These
          features focus on improving usability, maintainability, and
          performance.

                React components have lifecycle methods that are executed at
                specific points during a component's existence in the
                application, such as before it renders, after it renders, and
                before it is removed from the DOM.

        <h1>Who Developed React?</h1>
        <p>
          Jordan Walke and the team at Facebook are credited with the
          development of React. Walke created the first prototype which was
          influenced by his work on FaxJS, another earlier JavaScript framework.
        </p>
        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p>
          React was first used internally in 2011 and made open-source in May
          2013.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
          The development of React was driven by Facebook's need for a
          high-performance user interface library that could handle the dynamic
          and high-volume updates inherent in their increasingly complex
          applications like the Facebook newsfeed. Traditional data binding
          methods used in other frameworks could not efficiently handle such
          frequent updates. React introduced a virtual DOM that would allow
          Facebook to improve the performance of their applications by only
          re-rendering components in the DOM that had actually changed, rather
          than reloading the entire view every time a single change was made.
        </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h1>Who are Responsible for Managing React?</h1>
        <p>
          React.js is primarily managed and maintained by a team at Meta
          Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook), which includes both Facebook
          employees and a community of external contributors. Over the years,
          React has grown significantly in popularity and usage, which has
          attracted a large open-source community that contributes to its
          development, documentation, and ecosystem.

      <section class="section">
        <h1>React's Growth, Decline and the Future</h1>
        <h2>Growth</h2>
        <p>
          React.js has experienced significant growth due to its efficient
          virtual DOM, component-based architecture, and adoption by major
          companies like Facebook and Airbnb. The expansion to mobile
          development with React Native has further boosted its popularity.
        </p>
        <h2>Decline</h2>
        <p>
          However, React faces challenges from competing frameworks like Angular
          and Vue.js, and evolving web standards like Web Components. Managing
          large-scale applications can also be complex, potentially slowing its
          adoption.
        </p>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
          Despite these challenges, React's future looks promising. Ongoing
          improvements, strong market demand for React skills, and innovations
          like Hooks and server-side rendering with Next.js suggest that React
          will continue to be a key player in web development.

              <p>
                Each of these technologies has its own strengths and ideal use
                cases. React is praised for its flexibility and performance,
                making it suitable for dynamic, high-performance applications.
                Angular offers a more holistic solution with built-in features
                for larger, enterprise-level applications. Vue.js is appreciated
                for its ease of integration and simplicity, making it a favorite
                among new developers and smaller projects.
